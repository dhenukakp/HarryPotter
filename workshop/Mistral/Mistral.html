        Mistral AI is focused on developing models that are efficient and accessible. Mistral AI's models, such as the Mistral 7B, are trained on a variety of different datasets, including text, code and images. This makes them more versatile and adaptable than other models, often trained on a single data type.    </p>

    <h2 class="sub-heading">LLM</h2>
    <p class="tool-intro-content">A Large Language Model (LLM) is an artificial intelligence algorithm trained on massive amounts of data that is able to generate coherent text and perform various natural language processing tasks. Mistral is a large language model that has demonstrated strong performance in various natural language processing tasks.</p>

        <li><span>Fine Tuning</span>
            <p class="tool-intro-content">Mistral can be fine-tuned for specific applications, such as answering fact-based questions on complex documents with a focus on reducing hallucinations.</p>
        </li>
        <li><span>Hallucination</span>
            <p class="tool-intro-content">The fine-tuning process aims to minimize hallucinations, which are incorrect or nonsensical outputs produced by the model.</p>

        <li><span>RAG</span>
            <p class="tool-intro-content">Mistral is part of the dRAGon model series, which are trained with RAG-instruct.</p>
        </li>
        <li><span>Quantization</span>
            <p class="tool-intro-content">Quantization refers to a set of techniques that enable running models on resource-constrained platforms. 
                Higher quantization 'bit counts' (4 bits or more) generally preserve more quality, whereas lower levels compress the model further, which can lead to a significant loss in quality.Choose a quantization level that aligns with your hardware's capabilities and satisfies the performance needs of your task. If you're unsure which option to select, consider experimenting with a few different ones and perform your own evaluation.
